# Skotos: handoff notes

Read this first when picking the project up in a new session.

## Where things are

- Repo `bikakismanolis-rgb/abyssos`, game in `skotos/`, working branch `claude/sleepy-tesla-4030vd` (pull request #2 into the branch of #1). Commit only there.
- The playable build is a private claude.ai artifact: https://claude.ai/artifact/74dKQSTSnJmPAyDHBz4BRP (version 10 at the time of writing). Update it in place (same URL), never publish a new one.
- The owner writes in Greek; answer in Greek. The game text is Greek and English (`src/i18n/text.js`).
- Design and contracts: `docs/act4-design.md` (the Act IV plan), `docs/act4-contract.md`, `docs/act3-contract.md`. README.md describes every act (in Greek). CREDITS.txt, `src/ui/credits.js` and `src/assets/*/CREDITS.txt` list every third-party asset.

## State

- Acts I-IV are complete. Act IV ("The Ashen Forge") is the finale of the Ash Crown story; quest 23 is the end state. Post-game: the Shadow Gates (endless tiers, from Isarn's planted staff after the finale) and echo refights of the Act III and Act IV bosses.
- Act IV went through a full review (41 confirmed findings, all fixed); every scenario passes.
- Recent fixes worth knowing: models must load textures through `src/gfx/gltf.js` (the artifact host's Content-Security-Policy blocks `blob:` fetches, which made every model white); phones decode large maps at half size and release decoded images after upload (memory); a "How to play" panel (title menu, pause menu, H key, shown once at the first game); the title tap no longer falls through to "Continue".

## How to work

- `cd skotos && npm install` if needed; dev server `npx vite --port 5199 --strictPort`.
- Scenarios (Playwright, headless swiftshader): `node tools/scenario.mjs <name> <outdir>`. Names: Act I `combat, ranger, mage, weaver, lord, ending, title, panels`; Act II `pass, stonewarden, halls, king, ending2, cast2, boons`; Act III `weep, hart, heart, amaranthe, echo, ending3, cast3`; Act IV `ashfield, ivar, forge, karthax, ending4, cast4, echo4`. Run the ones touched by a change, and the whole set before publishing.
- Views: `?auto=<zone>&lvl=N&q=1` jumps into a zone; `?world=<zone>&at=...` world viewer; `?cview&only=...` creature viewer; `?viewer&only=p:<name>` people viewer. `tools/shot.mjs` takes screenshots. `tools/check-act3.mjs` and `tools/check-act4.mjs` check the generated layouts over many seeds.
- Publishing: `npm run build:artifact` writes `skotos/artifact/` (index.html fragment + assets/*.js, every file under 16 MB). Before publishing, serve it with `node tools/csp-server.mjs skotos/artifact <port> "<csp>"` using a strict CSP (`default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' data: blob:; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com; font-src https://fonts.gstatic.com data:; img-src 'self' data:; connect-src 'self' data:; media-src 'self' data:; worker-src 'self' blob:`) and check in Playwright (desktop and an `isMobile`/`hasTouch` context) that there are no CSP violations and no white models. Then publish `skotos/artifact/index.html` to the artifact URL with a `files` map: upload only the changed hashed files and set the removed ones to null.
- Assets: CC-BY 4.0 or CC0 only, credited everywhere; no rips of commercial games or films (the owner wants a Play Store release). Builders live in `tools/creatures/**` and `tools/pack-*.mjs`; sources are downloaded to `/tmp/claude-0/sf` and `/tmp/claude-0/ph` (not in the repo).
- Commit messages end with the session's Co-Authored-By and Claude-Session lines; never put a model name in commits or code.

## Open items

- Balance (owner's call): in Ivar's Dark a Mage is faster ignoring the braziers, because her own fire counts as light; with all three altar gifts taken, Karthax's cage phase lasts about 42 s against a ~30 s target.
- Not yet confirmed on a real phone that the memory changes stop the crash at high quality.
- Optional: unload the people sets, packs and creature files of other acts when far from them; the Forge's cranes can stand over lava in some seeds; Forgers and Hammerhorns share the seek() fallback that was fixed for Smoke-eaters; cinematics do not make the hero invulnerable (any act).
